# MW2 Alpha GTNW Mod (for IW4x, React)

A modification of the gametype Global Thermonuclear War for any MW2 PC client. I've made it as close as I could to the Alpha MW2 version, including having the nuke site as a crate and making an AC130 plane fly over the map and drop the nuke crate in the beginning of the match.

## Installation and Usage

### IW4x:

1. Download and place the gtnwmod folder into [iw4x_root]\mods
2. Launch your game, and load the mod by either typing /fs_game mods/gtnwmod in console or loading the mod from the Mods tab
3. Change the gametype to Global Thermonuclear War either by typing /g_gametype gtnw in console or by selecting it from the Change Gamemode tab
4. Enjoy!
